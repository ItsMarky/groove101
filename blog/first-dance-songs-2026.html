            <p>Your first dance is one of the most memorable moments of your wedding day. It's the first thing you do together as a married couple, and every guest will be watching. Choosing the right song can feel like a lot of pressure, but it doesn't have to be. Here are our top picks for 2026, along with honest advice from a band that's played hundreds of first dances.</p>

            <h2>Timeless Classics That Never Miss</h2>
            <p>These songs have been filling wedding dance floors for years, and for good reason. They work every time.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>"At Last" — Etta James</strong> — A classic slow dance with a gorgeous melody. Beautiful performed live with a horn section.</li>
                <li><strong>"Isn't She Lovely" — Stevie Wonder</strong> — Upbeat, joyful, and impossible not to smile to. Works brilliantly as a band arrangement.</li>
                <li><strong>"Let's Stay Together" — Al Green</strong> — Smooth, soulful, and romantic without being cheesy.</li>
                <li><strong>"You Are the Sunshine of My Life" — Stevie Wonder</strong> — A feel-good classic that suits couples who want something warm and relaxed.</li>
                <li><strong>"Signed, Sealed, Delivered" — Stevie Wonder</strong> — If you want to skip the slow sway and get straight to the party, this is the one.</li>
                <li><strong>"A Thousand Years" — Christina Perri</strong> — A modern classic that's become one of the most requested wedding songs of the last decade.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Modern Favourites for 2026</h2>
            <p>If you'd rather go with something more current, these songs are proving popular this year.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>"Perfect" — Ed Sheeran</strong> — Still one of the most requested first dance songs, and it translates beautifully to a live performance.</li>
                <li><strong>"All of Me" — John Legend</strong> — Heartfelt piano ballad that works equally well performed by a full band or stripped back.</li>
                <li><strong>"Golden" — Harry Styles</strong> — For couples who want something upbeat and feel-good rather than a traditional slow dance.</li>
                <li><strong>"Thinking Out Loud" — Ed Sheeran</strong> — The gentle rhythm makes it easy to dance to, even if you've got two left feet.</li>
                <li><strong>"Say You Won't Let Go" — James Arthur</strong> — Emotional, personal, and easy to sway to.</li>
                <li><strong>"Levitating" — Dua Lipa</strong> — A bold choice for couples who want to kick the party off immediately.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Funk & Soul Picks (Our Favourites)</h2>
            <p>As a funk and soul band, these are the first dance songs we love performing the most. They bring real energy and warmth to the room.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>"Lovely Day" — Bill Withers</strong> — That vocal note alone is enough to give everyone goosebumps. Uplifting and joyful.</li>
                <li><strong>"Best of My Love" — The Emotions</strong> — Disco-soul perfection. Great if you want a first dance that turns into a party.</li>
                <li><strong>"You Make My Dreams" — Hall & Oates</strong> — Pure feel-good energy. Impossible not to dance to.</li>
                <li><strong>"Adorn" — Miguel</strong> — A modern R&B gem with a smooth groove. Romantic without being slow.</li>
                <li><strong>"September" — Earth, Wind & Fire</strong> — Unconventional for a first dance, but if it's your song, own it.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>How to Choose the Right Song</h2>
            <p>With so many options, here's how to narrow it down.</p>

            <h3>Pick a song that means something to you</h3>
            <p>The best first dance songs aren't always the most popular ones — they're the ones with a story. Maybe it was playing on your first date, or it's the song you always sing in the car together. That personal connection matters more than what's trending.</p>

            <h3>Think about the tempo</h3>
            <p>Not everyone is comfortable with a slow waltz. If the thought of swaying in the spotlight for four minutes makes you nervous, pick something upbeat. There's no rule that says a first dance has to be slow. Some of the best first dances we've seen have been to fast, fun songs where the couple just let loose.</p>

            <h3>Consider the length</h3>
            <p>Most first dance songs are 3-4 minutes, but that can feel like a long time when every eye is on you. Talk to your band about doing a shorter arrangement, or plan to invite guests onto the floor halfway through.</p>

            <h3>Listen to a live version</h3>
            <p>A song can sound completely different performed live compared to the studio recording. Ask your band if they can send you a rough recording or point you to a live version online. What matters is how it sounds in a room, not through headphones.</p>

            <div class="cta-box">
                <h3>We'll Learn Your First Dance Song</h3>

            <h2>Live Band vs Recorded Track: Which is Better?</h2>
            <p>We're biased, obviously, but here's the honest case for both.</p>

            <p><strong>Recorded track:</strong> You get the exact version you know and love. No surprises. Good if the original production is complex or if the song has a very specific sound you can't replicate live.</p>

            <p><strong>Live band:</strong> There's something genuinely special about hearing your song performed by real musicians right in front of you. It's more intimate, more emotional, and your guests will remember it. A live first dance also makes for incredible photos and video — the band performing in the background adds atmosphere that a speaker on a stand just can't match.</p>

            <p>If your song suits a live arrangement (most do), we'd always recommend going live. It's one of those moments you won't regret.</p>

            <h2>Songs to Think Twice About</h2>
            <p>No judgement — it's your day. But a few things worth considering:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Very long songs</strong> — Anything over 4 minutes can feel like an eternity on the dance floor. Ask your band to do a shorter version.</li>
                <li><strong>Songs with sad lyrics</strong> — "Every Breath You Take" by The Police sounds romantic, but it's actually about obsession. Check the lyrics properly.</li>
                <li><strong>Songs nobody knows</strong> — Deep cuts are fine, but if nobody recognises it, you lose that collective moment of "oh I love this song" from your guests.</li>
                <li><strong>Songs that are difficult to dance to</strong> — Odd time signatures or dramatic tempo changes can make for an awkward dance. Run it past your band first.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>What to Do If You Can't Agree</h2>
            <p>It happens more than you'd think. One of you wants Etta James, the other wants Arctic Monkeys. Here are a few ways to handle it:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Compromise on genre:</strong> Find a song that sits between both your tastes.</li>
                <li><strong>Two-part first dance:</strong> Start with a slow song and transition into something upbeat. The crowd loves this.</li>
                <li><strong>Let the band decide:</strong> Tell us both options and we'll honestly tell you which one will work better in the room.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Final Thoughts</h2>
            <p>Your first dance doesn't need to be perfect — it needs to be yours. Whether you go for a classic slow dance or surprise everyone with something unexpected, the best first dances are the ones where the couple is genuinely enjoying themselves. The song is just the backdrop to a moment that's really about the two of you.</p>
