    <div class="article-container">
        <article class="article-content">
            <p>Not all wedding venues are created equal when it comes to live music. Some have brilliant acoustics and plenty of space for a full band. Others have noise restrictions, low ceilings, or limited power that can catch you off guard. As a band that's played at venues across Kent and the South East for over a decade, here's what we've learned about finding the right one.</p>

            <h2>What Makes a Venue Great for Live Music</h2>
            <p>Before we get into specific venues, here's what to look for when you're doing your visits.</p>

            <h3>Space for the band</h3>
            <p>A full band needs more room than you might think. As an 8-piece, we need a stage area of roughly 5 by 3 metres. That sounds like a lot, but most function rooms and barns can accommodate it comfortably. The key is to ask the venue early so there are no surprises on the day. Some venues have a dedicated stage or performance area, which is ideal.</p>

            <h3>Power supply</h3>
            <p>We need at least two 13A power sockets on separate circuits. Most modern venues handle this without issue, but older buildings, barns, and marquees sometimes need a generator or extra cabling. Your venue coordinator will usually know the setup, and we're always happy to do a site visit or chat with them directly to make sure everything's sorted.</p>

            <h3>Noise curfews and restrictions</h3>
            <p>This is the one that catches people out. Many venues in residential areas have strict noise curfews — often 11pm, sometimes earlier. Some have sound limiters fitted that will literally cut the power if you go above a certain volume. That's not the end of the world (we can work with limiters), but it's something you need to know before you book. Always ask the venue about their noise policy and share it with your band.</p>

            <h3>Ceiling height</h3>
            <p>Low ceilings can cause sound to bounce around and get muddy, especially with drums and brass. A room with some height to it — barn conversions, marquees, or function rooms with high ceilings — will always sound better. If the ceiling is low, a good band will adjust their volume and EQ to suit the room. We do this as standard.</p>

            <h3>Load-in access</h3>
            <p>We arrive with a van full of equipment and need roughly 90 minutes to set up. Ground-floor access with nearby parking makes a huge difference. Venues with stairs, narrow doorways, or long walks from the car park aren't deal-breakers, but they do add setup time. Worth mentioning to your band in advance.</p>

            <h2>Kent Venues We Love Playing</h2>
            <p>These are venues we've either performed at or know well through other bands and couples. They all work brilliantly for live music.</p>

            <h3>Hever Castle, near Edenbridge</h3>
            <p>Stunning grounds and a dedicated function space that handles live music really well. There's a sense of occasion here that's hard to beat. The rooms are well-suited to bands, with good ceiling height and proper power. If your budget allows it, this is a truly special setting.</p>

            <h3>Leeds Castle, Maidstone</h3>
            <p>One of Kent's most iconic venues. The Maiden's Tower and other event spaces offer a grand backdrop for a wedding reception with live music. Well-organised events team who are used to working with bands.</p>

            <h3>Chilston Park Hotel, Lenham</h3>
            <p>A country house hotel with real character. The function rooms have a warm, intimate feel that suits live music perfectly. Great for weddings of up to around 150 guests where you want the band to feel close to the action rather than performing from a distance.</p>

            <h3>The Pantiles, Royal Tunbridge Wells</h3>
            <p>We've played here for various events and it's always a fantastic atmosphere. The covered colonnade creates a unique setting for live music, particularly for summer events. There's something about playing outdoors (but sheltered) that gives the music a completely different energy.</p>

            <h3>Great Comp Garden, Borough Green</h3>
            <p>Beautiful garden setting that works wonderfully for marquee weddings. The outdoor space gives you flexibility with where to position the band, and the natural surroundings create a relaxed atmosphere that suits an evening of funk and soul perfectly.</p>

            <h3>Knowle Country House, Higham</h3>
            <p>A Georgian manor house with spacious rooms and good acoustics. Popular for weddings and well set up for live entertainment with plenty of room for a dance floor in front of the band.</p>

            <h3>The Barn at South Milton, near Sittingbourne</h3>
            <p>Barn conversions are some of our favourite places to play. The high ceilings and rustic character create an incredible atmosphere for live music. The exposed beams and wooden floors add a natural warmth to the sound that you just can't recreate in a hotel function room.</p>

            <h2>Questions to Ask Your Venue About Live Music</h2>
            <p>When you're visiting venues, these are the questions that will save you headaches later.</p>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Is there a noise curfew?</strong> What time does live music need to stop? Is there a sound limiter?</li>
                <li><strong>Where would the band set up?</strong> Is there a designated stage area or will they be in the corner of the room?</li>
                <li><strong>What power is available?</strong> How many sockets, and are they on separate circuits?</li>
                <li><strong>Where can the band load in?</strong> Is there ground-floor access and parking nearby?</li>
                <li><strong>Are there any volume restrictions?</strong> Some venues have decibel limits even without a sound limiter.</li>
                <li><strong>Is there a changing room for the band?</strong> Not essential, but appreciated — especially if it's a long day.</li>
                <li><strong>Have you hosted live bands before?</strong> Venues that regularly have bands will have the logistics sorted. First-timers might need a bit more coordination.</li>
            </ol>

            <h2>Marquee Weddings: What to Know</h2>
            <p>Marquee weddings are increasingly popular in Kent, and they can be brilliant for live music — but they come with a few extra considerations.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Power:</strong> You'll almost certainly need a generator. Make sure it's powerful enough for the band's PA and any other equipment (lighting, catering). A 10kVA generator is usually sufficient for a full band setup.</li>
                <li><strong>Flooring:</strong> A proper dance floor makes a massive difference. Grass is fine for the guests' seating area, but you need a solid, level surface for the band and the dancing.</li>
                <li><strong>Weather:</strong> If the marquee has open sides, wind can play havoc with music stands and lighter equipment. Let your band know the setup in advance so they can prepare.</li>
                <li><strong>Sound:</strong> Marquees can actually sound really good because the canvas absorbs some of the high frequencies that bounce around in hard-walled rooms. The result is often a warmer, more natural sound.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>A Note on Sound Limiters</h2>
            <p>If your venue has a sound limiter, don't panic. It doesn't mean you can't have a live band — it just means the band needs to be aware of it. An experienced band will know how to manage their volume and still deliver a great show. We deal with sound limiters regularly and it's rarely a problem. The key is communication: tell your band about the limiter as early as possible so they can plan their setup accordingly.</p>

            <p>What does cause problems is finding out about the limiter on the night. That's when things get tricky. So ask the question early.</p>

            <h2>Final Thoughts</h2>
            <p>The right venue will make your live music shine. The wrong one can hold it back. But most problems are avoidable with a bit of planning and the right questions. If you've found a venue you love but aren't sure how it'll work with a live band, get in touch. We're always happy to chat through the practicalities and even speak with your venue directly to make sure everything runs smoothly.</p>
